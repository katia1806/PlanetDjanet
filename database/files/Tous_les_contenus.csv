"The white crowned wheatear or ""Moula Moula"" in local tamahaq. The nomad's companion, a bird perfectly adapted to the desert life and is said to be a good omen by the Touaregs. The Moula Moula associated the presence of nomads/tourist groups to the presence of food (leftovers) and so became less fearful in these areas. It mainly eats insects and small lizards.
